# Switch Circuit Project

## Requirements:
  - [LogiSim Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution.git)

The main goal was to create and design a system that could flip the capitalization of letters entered via the LogiSim keyboard from on command while in synchronization with a clock. The required functionality for one part of the system was the detection of a code term “ Flip ”, regardless of case-sensitivity, in order to enable activation of other subsystems and notify such signals with a red light. It's important to mention that the requirements dictated for a space before as well as after the word FLIP. Then, the activation would enable the case switching circuit to change the text entered until the code word was entered again and so on.
